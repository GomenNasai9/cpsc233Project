Our project is made up of four classes, and a main method. The four classes are Income, BudgetCalculator, Expensis, and Meme. The main method is the one that should be run, and it will get the information from the other classes.

To run the program properly, you only have to run the main method, but have to have all the classes in the same directory since they all take information form each other. Keep in mind that with the memes class you have a folder containing all the memes so that it runs properly.

 Type javac and then the file name.java to compile the file; compile them 1 by 1 is better than compiling them all with *.java. Then run the main method with java and then type Main.

**Instructions** 
1. In the command prompt, type 'git clone https://github.com/GomenNasai9/cpsc233Project.git' to clone the cpsc233Project repository.
2. Change the directory using 'cd [folder name]'.
3. Change the directory to the folder named 'Edited'
To run our program properly, you need to download Edited file from Github and compile whole file with javac *.java on your command prompt. And then run the Main.java by typing java Main on your prompt.
when the command prompt is showing you need to type any positive number to start the program(it's something we need to fix).
